# Traveling-Salesman

This is a version of the Traveling Salesman Problem:

You make your living as a crop duster, flying a plane to spray farmer's fields with herbicides, pesticides and firtilizer.

Only two costs: 
- fuel for your plane which burns 10 gallons of fuel per hour when it is in the air, and chemicals.
- It takes 25 gallons of chemicals and on half hour of flying to "dust" each field. 

In addition, you have to fly to and from the field and your fuel&chemical reloading points. Your plane holds 50 gallons of fuel and 100 gallons of chemicals, and flies at 100 miles per hour. It takes 15 minutes to fuel your plane and 30 minutes to load chemicals. Your activity takes place on a grid that is 100 miles north to south and 100 miles east to west, with the origin (0, 0) at the southwest corner. A grid point of (25, 30) would therefore be 25 miles north and 30 miles east of the origin. You will need to use trigonometry to calculate flying distances.

Your home base is at (20, 25) and fuel there is $5 a gallon. Chemicals are $16 a gallon. There is another base at (70, 80) where fuel is $6 a gallon and chemicals are $15 a gallon.

Calculate the most profitable route.
